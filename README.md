eeiv
====

**eeiv** is a _very_ simple image viewer that uses the [eepp](https://github.com/SpartanJ/eepp)
library to decode and show the images on screen. It was implemented a long time
ago for my own needs. It does not represent at all the capabilities of eepp, so
please don't take it as an example.

The image viewer does not implement any kind of UI, only uses keyboard shortcuts
and has an internal command line console that implements various image
manipulation functionalities.

The code is awful and old, I never had time to implement a decent image editor,
but I still use it on a daily basis.

Image formats supported: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TGA, DDS, PKM, PSD (thumbnails),
HDR, PIC, PVR, SVG (rasterized).

For the moment I don't have enough time to work on a tutorial on how to build
it or create public releases of the application. I'll try to create a v2 of this
application soon and publish the application.
